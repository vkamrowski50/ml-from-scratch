## ML From Scratch

Self-built machine learning library from the ground up.
I (**Victor Kamrowski**) started this project to deepen my understanding of ML algorithms by building them without libraries.

## Features

- Linear Regression model
    - Gradient descent training
    - Manual data entry through CLI
    - Prediction and model display
    - Error handling for edge cases
- Command-line interface
- Clean modular structure

## Getting Started

### Run the model:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Options:
1. Add data points
2. Train using gradient descent
3. Predict output from input
4. View current linear equation
5. Exit

## ML From Scratch

Self-built machine learning library from the ground up.
I (**Victor Kamrowski**) started this project to deepen my understanding of core ML algorithms by implementing them without any libraries.

## Features

- **Linear Regression**
    - Gradient descent training
    - Manual data entry through CLI
    - Prediction and model display
    - Error handling for edge cases
- Command-line interface
- Clean modular structure

## Getting Started

### Run the model:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Options:
1. Add data points
2. Train using gradient descent
3. Predict output from input
4. View current linear equation
5. Exit

## Future Plans

- Add cost function display (MSE)
- Batch data input
- More models (logistic regression, k-NN, etc.)
- Visualization (e.g. matplotlib)
- Unit tests, CLI enhancement

## Motivation

I started this project to get a foundational understanding of machine learning. I learned the proper math (gradients, partial derivatives, etc.) and mechanics of ML algorithms (MSE, minimizing MSE by taking the partial derivative with respect to both slope and y-intercept variables, etc.). I did this so I could internalize the basic principles, not just implement them. To stengthen my theoretical foundation, I've been reading **Introduction to Probability** by **Joseph K. Blitzstein** and **Jessica Hwang** for future endeavors relating to probability computing.
